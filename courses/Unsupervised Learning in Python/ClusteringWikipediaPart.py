/* It is now time to put your pipeline from the previous exercise to work! You are given an array articles of tf-idf word-frequencies of some popular Wikipedia articles, and a list titles of their titles. Use your pipeline to cluster the Wikipedia articles.

A solution to the previous exercise has been pre-loaded for you, so a Pipeline pipeline chaining TruncatedSVD with KMeans is available. */

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Fit the pipeline to articles
pipeline.fit(articles)

# Calculate the cluster labels: labels
labels = pipeline.predict(articles)

# Create a DataFrame aligning labels and titles: df
df = pd.DataFrame({'label': labels, 'article': titles})

# Display df sorted by cluster label
print(df.sort_values('label'))
