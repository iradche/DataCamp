/* In chapter 1, you used k-means clustering to cluster companies according to their stock price movements. Now, you'll perform hierarchical clustering of the companies. You are given a NumPy array of price movements movements, where the rows correspond to companies, and a list of the company names companies. SciPy hierarchical clustering doesn't fit into a sklearn pipeline, so you'll need to use the normalize() function from sklearn.preprocessing instead of Normalizer.

linkage and dendrogram have already been imported from sklearn.cluster.hierarchy, and PyPlot has been imported as plt. */

# Import normalize
from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize

# Normalize the movements: normalized_movements
normalized_movements = normalize(movements)

# Calculate the linkage: mergings
