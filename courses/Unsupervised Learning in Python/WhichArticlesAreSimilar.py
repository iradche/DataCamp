/* In the video, you learned how to use NMF features and the cosine similarity to find similar articles. Apply this to your NMF model for popular Wikipedia articles, by finding the articles most similar to the article about the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. The NMF features you obtained earlier are available as nmf_features, while titles is a list of the article titles. */

# Perform the necessary imports
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize

# Normalize the NMF features: norm_features
norm_features = normalize(nmf_features)

# Create a DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(norm_features, index=titles)

# Select the row corresponding to 'Cristiano Ronaldo': article
article = df.loc['Cristiano Ronaldo']

# Compute the dot products: similarities
similarities = df.dot(article)

# Display those with the largest cosine similarity
print(similarities.nlargest())
